# Jarrod's Job Search System

This repo will contain my fullstack app for a systematic job search. I will be coding this app while using it to search for a job as a software developer.

## Learning Goals

These are the pieces I will be focussing on for maximizing learning.

### API

* Authentication
* GraphQL
* TypeScript

I'm looking to learn about creating and working with Access Control Lists as well as JSON Web Tokens (JWT). I've only dabbled with TypeScript and GraphQL so I expect to learn a great deal by building a full system using them.

### Client

* TypeScript
* GraphQL
* Dynamic Form Builder

As with the backend I expect to learn TypeScript and GraphQL more thoroughly for frontend implementations. I've been thinking about building a form that allows the user to define the fields and have a few places where I believe this app would benefit from such.

## Key Tech

Here is the list of libraries, frameworks, etc. that I intend to use at the outset (*2020-03-07*) and a few things I am leaning towards.
